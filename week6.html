    <h2>Week 6: More node and Web-Services</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Learning about web services this week opened yet another door to new possibilities in the realm of web
        development. I find it fascinating that you could use http to transfer non html data in order to interact with
        some form of service. This was cool because I could use it to do many things, and also help with making a
        network of bot clients that could connect to a host service. I also found it interesting that there was such a
        simple way to establish a web service on the local host. After doing a lot more boilerplate work in CS 361, the
        simplicity of the method calls was refreshing to say the least. I hope that in the future, I can make a web
        service to synchronize some of my perosnal bots that perform daily activities for me.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I had so much fun last week that I decided to continue making bots using node, and this week I decided to make a
        bot the could create a google account and save its details in a file for me. This is the beginning of a much
        larger project that I hope to continue in the coming weeks. The bot will simple fill out fields for the google
        sign up and then create the account. It then saves the details in a file so that I can use them in the future.
        This is entirely for education purposes, so the account will be deleted after its creation to not disturb or
        waste server space. Here is the code for my google account creator:
        <pre>
            <code>
const {ActionSequence, Builder, By, Key, util} = require("selenium-webdriver");

const usernameCharacters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';
const passwordCharacters = '!@#$%&'

function generateUsername(length) {
    let username = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        username += usernameCharacters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * usernameCharacters.length));
    }
    return username;
}

function generatePassword() {
    let password = generateUsername(10);
    password.concat(passwordCharacters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * passwordCharacters.length)));
    return password;
}

function sleep(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
  }
  

async function example()
{
    let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();
    await driver.get("http://google.com");
    await driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[text()='Sign in']")).click();
    await driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[text()='Create account']")).click();
    await driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[text()='For myself']")).click();
    await driver.findElement(By.name("firstName")).sendKeys("John");
    await driver.findElement(By.name("lastName")).sendKeys("Smith");
    let username = generateUsername(20);
    await driver.findElement(By.name("Username")).sendKeys(username);
    let password = generatePassword();
    await driver.findElement(By.name("Passwd")).sendKeys(password);
    await driver.findElement(By.name("ConfirmPasswd")).sendKeys(password);
    await driver.actions({bridge : true}).sendKeys(Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.RETURN).perform();
    sleep(2000);
    await driver.actions({bridge : true}).sendKeys(Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.TAB).perform();
    await driver.actions({bridge : true}).sendKeys("7037058881").perform();
    await driver.actions({bridge : true}).sendKeys(Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.RETURN).perform();
}
example();
