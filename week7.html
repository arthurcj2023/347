    <h2>Week 7: Introduction to React, and FollowBot Pt.2</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        This week the main focus was finishing the web service and getting a quick introduction to react. I found react 
        to be very complicated in nature. I felt that there was a lot going on behind the scenes that I didn't fully understand, 
        which is one my least favorite things about using libraries. I hope to spend some time this weekend learning more about 
        what React is doing behind the App.jsx file. I did learn about dom and ref elements, and how to create js objects that 
        could represent a collection of html elements, and dynamically add them to the page. I thought that these things could
        be done in node without needing react, so I am interested to see what react does that a node library I could build
        myself wouldn't. What I'm trying to say is that I am currently skeptical about the cost versus efficiency of the react
        framework, and if there is a future where another library besides angular will replace react making learning the specific
        framework less important.

        In terms of what I did this week for personal learning, I built upon my email account creator and coded an instagram 
        account creator that can create instagram accounts using the email accounts that can be generated with the email account
        generator. This is part 2/3 of this project as I will need to set up the instagram bot accounts to follow a specific user
        and like all of their posts. This was less of a challenge than with google, because google had some of their signup forms
        set to not be tabbable and have a randomly generated id. With instagram it is a lot simpler because instagram had a static
        name attribute on all of the input tags, making it easier for me to direct selenium webdriver towards them. As with the last 
        bot. This bot generator is solely for the experience gained with learning how to gerneate bots, and all bots created during 
        testing and used will be handled ethically and will be deleted to save server space once testing is over. The code below 
        creates and verifies an instagram accoun and logs the password to the console. The way to cghange the email is to change
        the string with {REDACTED} in it ath the bottom of the file.
        <pre>
            <code>
const { Builder, By, Capabilities, Key } = require("selenium-webdriver");
const chrome = require('selenium-webdriver/chrome');

const usernameCharacters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';
const passwordCharacters = '!@#$%&'

function generateUsername(length) {
    let username = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        username += usernameCharacters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * usernameCharacters.length));
    }
    return username;
}

function generatePassword() {
    let password = generateUsername(10);
    password.concat(passwordCharacters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * passwordCharacters.length)));
    return password;
}

function sleep(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}


async function generateInstagram(email) {
    let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();
    await driver.get("https://www.instagram.com/accounts/emailsignup/");
    await sleep(2000);
    await driver.findElement(By.name("emailOrPhone")).sendKeys(email);
    let firstName = generateUsername(6);
    let lastName = generateUsername(6);
    await driver.findElement(By.name("fullName")).sendKeys(firstName + " " + lastName);
    let username = generateUsername(10);
    await driver.findElement(By.name("username")).sendKeys(username);
    let password = generatePassword(10);
    await driver.findElement(By.name("password")).sendKeys(password);
    await driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[text()='Sign up']")).click();
    await sleep(2000);
    await driver.actions({ bridge: true }).sendKeys(Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.RETURN, Key.UP, Key.UP, Key.UP, Key.RETURN).perform();
    await sleep(1000);
    await driver.actions({ bridge: true }).sendKeys(Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.RETURN, Key.UP, Key.UP, Key.RETURN).perform();
    await driver.actions({ bridge: true }).sendKeys(Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.TAB, Key.RETURN).perform();
    for (let i = 0; i < 18; i++) {
        await driver.actions({ bridge: true }).sendKeys(Key.DOWN).perform();
    }
    await driver.actions({ bridge: true }).sendKeys(Key.RETURN, Key.TAB, Key.RETURN).perform();
    driver.close();
}
generateInstagram("{REDACTED}}");
