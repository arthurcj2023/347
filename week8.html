    <h2>Week 8: React States, and Objects</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        In class this week, we worked on building up our knowledge on React JS. We looked at creating objects that could represent
        a collection of html elements, and we also looked at state handling and how to edit variables, so that the website can 
        update with data that can be changed in real time. I found it interesting that a state object is an array of two values,
        one being like a getter, and the other like a setter. I also learned about how React interprests JSX different from JS.
        Learning all of this helped me understand the power and versatility of React, which I felt unimpressed by in previous
        weeks. I like the idea of representing a collection of tags as an object because it makes writing functions more generic
        for collections of data that follow the same template. I hope that in future weeks we can use some other way to store
        state variables, maybe a container so that state variables dont have to be individually declared.
    </p>

        This week, I took a break from the instagram follow bot. I instead played around with the react api and with the props, and
        components system. I found it very interesting that you could pass the setter function of the state array into the props of
        a component and then call that function from inside it. I played around with this, and eventually figured out that I could
        pass a function into a component. Then I could bind trhe argument of the function to the component itself, and then, whenever
        the function is called from the component, it will automatically call the function with the same component mapping. 
    </p>
        <pre>
            <code>class ComponentTester extends React.Component {
                constructor(props) {
                    super(props);
                    this.reflexiveFunction = props.reflexiveFunction.bind(this);
                }

                render() {
                    return (&lt;p&gt;Test text&lt;/p&gt;)
                }
            }
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
        I didn't make any deliverable from this, but I continued to mess around with the limitations of props trying to see if I
        could get it to do other things, such as modify other components based off of parameters in itself.
