    <h2>Week 3: Responsive Design with Flex Boxes</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Flex boxes are very interesting. they have rules, but they are less about rules and more like a suggestion. You
        could tell two boxes to be next to eachother, but if the page gets small enough they may end up on top of
        eachother. I find it most interesting that flex boxes make it possible for items to flex in size, not just
        position. this is done using the flex: auto; or flex: 1 1 auto; It took a while to understand task 1 of the lab
        on thursday, once I got it I felt that I had a much better understaning of flexboxes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>In order to help learn about flexboxes on my own thime, I used the text on the twodee.org site as well as on
        css-tricks.com in order to get a more full understanding of the capabilities and limitations of flexboxes. It
        was on css-tricks where I learned about the flex: auto; which handles all expanding, shrinking and weights
        automatically based off of the initial size of the image. This helped me greatly in creating a more simple
        solution to Task 1 on thursdays lab. I also used W3 Schools to be able to quickly test different flex layouts
        using &ltdiv&gt tags with colored backgrounds. I used that to learn about a flex container versus a flex child
        and the different parameters that need to be set in order to distinguish them. my favorite attribute is
        flex-flow as it allows you to set the wrapping attribute as well as the row or column orientation of the flex
        layout.
