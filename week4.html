    <h2>Week 4: Media queries and responsive design</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Media queries allow a webstie to be usable for more purposes than a person to just look at. A user could be
        listening to a page from a screen reader or maybe the reader does not have a graphical interface to display
        colored boxes onto. The solution to this is media queries. Media queries allow web content to be tailored to the
        type of webpage viewer being used in order to reduce load times and increase readability for less common reading
        types. I found the mode interesting query types were media="scripting" which handles whether the source can run
        javascript or not, and media="update" which handles how often the display off the content can be updated.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I also looked at w3Schools to see how to design for mobile using media queries, and the idea of a mobile-first
        design paradigm where the page is optimized for mobile phones and viewers due to less processing power and then
        build the computer site to display the same content. This was an interesting idea that I implemented in this
        page. THe way w3schools did it was to check the minimum screen width of the window in order to tell what type of
        device the viewer is. I used this approach, but found that results were dependent on the resolution of the phone
        because some modern phones have 4k screens built into the phone. I would guess that there is a way to see the
        type of os the device is running, or a flag set in the browser whether the device is a mobile device or not.
        That being said, setting it to mobile by default handles most mobile phone cases quite well.
