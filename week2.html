    <h2>Week 2: Making things fancy with <span class="blink">CSS</span></h2>
    <br>
    <p>It feels so nice to be able to make things all colorful and animated. CSS really breathes life into a webpage and
        makes or breaks the user experience. My favorite part of this week was the twist on css where the objective was
        to make a word using only div boxes, it really let me stretch my wings and really changed how I think about divs
        and inline styling, as well as margins versus padding. I feel like there is still another evoultion that needs
        to be done and that is adding javascript to a page to make some style more automated and less reliant on css. I
        hope that next week we dabble in the style side of javascript.
    </p>

    <p>In terms of what I did to enhance my own learning outside of class, I got the style for the title from a stack
        overflow post, and I used w3 schools to play around with other types of animations in css. I found out that
        animations could be reversed or played forward and that there were ways to change the position and color of
        elements in order to customize a page more. I used that knowledge to make the animation below this paragraph!

    <div style="text-align: center; padding: 100px">
        <img src="Kaotiq.png" class="image" alt="Kaotiq Logo">
    </div>
