    <h2>Week 1: Raw HTML</h2>
    <p>I know "Raw HTML" is an interesting name for this week, but I think it describes what we did quite well. Think
        about a website with CSS and JS running behind it, its like a well cooked steak with all of the flavor. This
        week was mainly focused on just html similar to a raw steak on a store shelf. On a more serious side, I learned
        about a lot of legacy tags that can be used, such as the blockquote tag and the center tag. It helped me
        appreciate what CSS has done to make styling and positioning better and it also helps me appreciate things
        such as ReactJS and AngularJS more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I also got a refresher about inline and flexbox elements, and got to see things like the old &lta&gt tag styling
        and the &ltblockquote&gt tag that make padding simple and easy at the cost of customizability that is evident
        when using just HTML tags. There was always a way to insert css into HTML tags with the style="" attribute that
        can be set inside the HTML tag. If there is one big picture idea that can be taken away from this week is that
        html is an old system that was built on top of over time rather than something that got more tags when more
        customization was needed.
